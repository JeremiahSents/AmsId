#  The Dockerfile is pretty straightforward. It uses the  node:18-alpine  image as a base image, sets the working directory to  /app , copies the package files, installs the dependencies, copies the rest of the code, exposes port 3000, sets the host environment variable, and runs the development command with the host flag. 
#  Now, letâ€™s create a  docker-compose.yml  file in the root directory of the project. 
#  version: '3.8'
